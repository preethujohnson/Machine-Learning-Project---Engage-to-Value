        "Linear Regression is the simplest regression model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the continuous target variable. It fits a line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
        "Why use it:\n",
        "- Acts as a strong baseline to compare other models against.\n",
        "- Easy to interpret coefficients.\n",
        "- Fast to train and requires less computational power.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Random Forest Regressor\n",
        "Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees where each tree is trained on a random subset of data and features. The final prediction is the average of predictions from all trees.\n",
        "Why use it:\n",
        "- Handles nonlinear relationships well.\n",
        "- Robust to outliers and noise.\n",
        "- Less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees.\n",
        "- Requires minimal data preprocessing (no scaling needed).\n",

        "3. Decision Tree Regressor\n",
        "A Decision Tree Regressor splits the data into regions based on feature values by creating a tree of decisions. It predicts the target by averaging the values in each region (leaf node).\n",

        "- Captures nonlinear relationships.\n",
        "- Fast to train on moderate-sized datasets.\n",
        "- Serves as a good simple nonlinear baseline before ensembles.\n",

        "4. XGBoost Regressor\n",
        "XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, where each new tree attempts to correct errors made by previous trees. It uses gradient descent optimization and regularization.\n",

        "- Efficient and fast with built-in handling of missing values.\n",
        "- Supports parallel processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)\n",
        "SVR extends Support Vector Machines to regression problems by fitting the best line within a margin (epsilon) around the data points. It tries to keep errors within this margin, effectively ignoring small errors.\n",
        "Why use it:\n",
        "- Effective for datasets with smaller sizes.\n",
        "- Can model nonlinear relationships using kernels (e.g., RBF kernel).\n",
        "- Good if you expect sparse data or need robustness to outliers."
