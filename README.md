# Machine-Learning-Project---Engage-to-Value
This project is about building an intelligent system that can analyze these kinds of user behaviors across multiple digital touchpoints and predict how much a user might spend on an actual purchase. Using Machine Learning, I aim to learn patterns from users who purchased in past and use that knowledge to predict the spending behavior for new users.
